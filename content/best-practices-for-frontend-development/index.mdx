This is to ensure that a website looks good on different screens.An example using tailwind:

```html
<article className="prose md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl">
   <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>
   <p>
      For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread
      with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an iconic status
      in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm, cheesy loaf for
      Halloween.

## Examples of best practices

We are gonna talk about some of the best practices that web developers should put into considerations.

Here are some best practices in building frontend :

1. Responsiveness
2. Use of images.
3. Cross-browser compatibility.


Now we're going to try out another header style.

### Responsiveness

Ensuring that your website looks and functions seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes is paramount for providing an optimal user experience. Responsive design allows your site to adapt dynamically to different viewport sizes, enhancing accessibility and usability.

Example:

```html
<article className="prose md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl">
   <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>
   <p>
      For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread
      with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an iconic status
      in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm, cheesy loaf for
      Halloween.

### Use of images

Images play a significant role in enhancing the visual appeal and storytelling capability of a website. However, it's essential to use them judiciously, ensuring they complement the content without compromising page load times.

<Image
   src='/blogs/frontend.jpg'
   width='718'
   height='404'
   alt='Image'
   sizes='100vw'
/>

Using appropriate image sizes and formats, lazy loading, and optimizing images for web can significantly improve website performance.

### Cross-Browser Compatibility

Ensuring that your website functions consistently across different web browsers is vital for reaching a broader audience and maintaining user satisfaction. This involves testing your site's compatibility with popular browsers and addressing any compatibility issues that arise.

```js
// JavaScript code for detecting browser compatibility
if (
   navigator.userAgent.indexOf("MSIE") !== -1 ||
   navigator.appVersion.indexOf("Trident/") > -1
) {
   // Code for Internet Explorer
} else {
   // Code for other browsers
}
```

Using CSS prefixes and feature detection libraries can help mitigate compatibility issues across browsers.

## Conclusion

Incorporating these best practices into your frontend development process can significantly improve the overall quality, performance, and user experience of your website. By prioritizing responsiveness, optimizing image usage, ensuring cross-browser compatibility, and maintaining consistency, you can create web experiences that resonate with your audience and drive success for your projects. Remember to stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in frontend development to continuously refine and enhance your skills.
